 <p> Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Anita Snyder and I am a professional soccer player. I started playing soccer 
   when I was four years old in my home town of St. Louis, MO. My mom is an immagrent from Portugal and is a huge soccer fan. When she was 25 years
  old she came to America and met my father. My dad was also a professional soccer player and has coached me my entire life. </p>
