    <p> I have many hobbies that I have developed over the years. Obviously, I love all things sports related. Whether it's watching sports 
        on TV with my friends and family or playing soccer, I always enhoy doing anything sport related. When I was growing up I played high school soccer,
        ran cross country and played Lacrosse. I also enjoy all things outdoors. I like to water ski and hike in the Summer and snow ski in the Winter. 
        
        I also enjoy going for a night out with my friends. I like nice dinners and drinking wine. I also love game nights with my friends!. 

        Another hobby of mine is reading books, below are some of my favorites!
